"보는것 만으로 끝난 가상으로 비행기 조정이나 밀랍인형 만들기가 전에는 됬던거 같은데 고장 중 전에는 2층도 전시장 이였나본데 3,4 층만 전시 중 관람자 입장에선 두개층 보는데 만오천원은 비쌈",당신또,3,775,"I think it was before adjusting the plane or making a wax figure, but before it broke down, the second floor must have been an exhibition hall, but only the third and fourth floors are on display. The viewer sees the second floor, but 15,000 won is the beef wrap."
밀랍인형 을지로역 근처에 위치한 그레뱅 뮤지엄입니다. 인터넷으로 미리 예약시 할인이 가능하며 여러 유명인의 밀랍인형이 있고 중간중간 게임 체험과 일층의 쇼핑공간이 있습니다.,polonara80,5,775,"This is the Grevin Museum located near Euljiro Station, a wax doll. You can get a discount if you make a reservation online in advance. There are many famous wax figures, game experience, and shopping space on the first floor."
인물 공부가 되는 곳 위인 유명인 등 밀랍인형이 정교하게 만들어져 있어서 공브도 되고 설정샷 찍기 좋아요. 외국관광객이 많습니다. 방학땐 수업도 있습니다.,GE Kim,5,775,"The wax figures, such as the celebrity, and the place where you can study characters, are exquisitely made, so it can be a public broadcast and it's good to take photos.m. There are many foreign tourists. I have classes during vacation."
"리얼함 비싼 티켓값하는 전시, 인스타용 사진 찍기 좋은곳. 꼭 한번은 가볼만한 곳. 사진 찍으면 정말 실묾과 함께한 것 같고, 체험 하는것들도 재밌습니다. 인물화한테 직업설게 에도 도움된다",yoon yen,5,775,"Real and expensive ticket prices, a good place to take pictures for Instagram. a must-see place Taking pictures seems to have been with real life, and experiencing things is fun. It's also helpful to have a career in character painting."
신기한 경험 문화가 있는날 저렴하게 표를 구매해서 다녀왔습니다. 티켓에 바코드는 체험이벤트에 이용할수 있으니 티켓 보관은 필수 . 실제인듯 아닌듯 신기했네요,Yoonjung C,4,775,"I bought a cheap ticket on a day when I had an interesting experience culture. The barcode on the ticket can be used for the experience event, so keeping the ticket is a must. It was interesting that it wasn't real."
갑자기 결정하고 간거 치고는 굿! 밀랍인형 마담 투쏘만 있는줄 알았는데 명동에 이런게 있는 줄 몰랐어요! 몇개는 너무 허접했는데 이것저것 재미있는 구경거리도 많고 생각보다 많이 전시되어 있더라구요 ~ 재미있었어요,Yeonah D,5,775,"Good for a sudden decision! I thought there was only Madame Tussauds, a wax figure, but I didn't know there was something like this in Myeongdong! Some of them were so sloppy, but there were a lot of fun things to see and there were more exhibits than I thought. It was fun."
처음가본 밀랍인형 뮤지엄!! 밀랍인형 뮤지엄이라하면 마담투쏘밖에 없는줄 알았는데 그레뱅이라는게 있었음! 정말 똑같이 잘만들어진 인형이 있는반면 살짝 안그런것도 있어보임. 가격도 생각보다 저렴한 편이고 커플끼리 컨셉잡고 사진찍고 놀기짱인듯 ㅋ,kpcooldawg,5,775,"First wax museum I've ever been to! I thought there was only Madame Tussauds in the wax museum, but there was Grevin! While there are dolls that are well-made, there seems to be ones that are slightly. The price is cheaper than I thought, and it's great to have a concept, take a picture, and play with each other."
재미있고 유익했어요!! 실제 유명 인물들과 너무 비슷해서 놀랐어요~ 심지어 손가락 지문까지 있는거 보고 디테일함에 놀랐네요~ 중간중간 체험코스 있어서 지루하지 않게 즐길 수 있었어요:) 어른 어린이 막론하고 재미있게 놀다 갈 수 있어요~ 추천합니당😀,한솔 김,5,775,"It was fun and informative!! I was surprised because they were so similar to real celebrities. I was surprised to see their finger prints. There was an experience course from time to time, so I was able to enjoy it without being bored:) Regardless of whether it's an adult or not, you can have fun. Recommended 😀😀"
좋았어요~ 아시아나 멤버쉽 사용해서 할인 받았어요. 가격은 좀 비싼 것 같지만 볼거리는 많은편이었어요.,missaj123,4,775,"It was good~ I got a discount using Asiana membership. The price seems a bit expensive, but there were a lot of things to see."
절대 홍보는 아니지만 가격만 어떻게 커버가 된다면 괜찮은 곳 사실 이러한 장소는 한국에서는 관람료가 상당히 비싼 축에 속한다. 우리가 흔히 생각하는 박물관이라는 다르게 '뮤지엄' 이라는 단어가 포함된 상태에서 가격은 생각보다 비싸기 때문. 하지만 내부의 밀랍인형들이 한 번은 볼만하고 무엇보다 로비에 있는 식당이 생각보다 꽤 맛있으니 한 번쯤은 방문하는 것을 추천함.,yeong310,5,775,"It's not a promotion, but it's okay if the price is covered. In fact, these places are one of the most expensive places in Korea. This is because the price is higher than expected when the word ""museum"" is included differently from what we commonly think of as a museum. However, the wax figures inside are worth seeing at least once, and most of all, the restaurant in the lobby is quite delicious, so I recommend you visit at least once."
퀄리티가 정말 좋은 박물관 여려종류의 인형들도 있고 다양햔 체험할수있는 것들이 많아서 구경하기 좋아요! 밀납인형이 특히 신기했어요 ㅎㅎ,수리23,5,775,"There are many kinds of dolls in the museum with great quality, so it's great to see! It was particularly interesting to see the puppet. Haha"
좋아요 가족과 왔는데 재미있네요 좋아요 ㅎㅎ 아기가 재미있어하네요 시내라 찾기도 쉬워요 2호선타고 왔는데 롯데 근처라 찾기 쉬워요,승보 박,5,775,Okay. I'm with my family. It's fun. Good. The baby is having fun. It's easy to find because it's downtown. I took Line 2 and it's easy to find it because it's near Lotte.
좋아요 평소 뮤지엄 관람을 좋아하고 예술작품관람을 좋아해서 들렸습니다. 좋은 전시가있으면 또 들릴예정입니다.,dkfma0657,5,775,"Good. I stopped by because I usually like to see museums and art works. If there is a good exhibition, I will stop by again."
"이색적이고 재밌는 경험 한번쯤 가볼만 해요! 사진 찍을 만한 포인트가 많아서 곳곳 재밌게 관람했어요 매번 같은 전시물만 있는게 아니라 밀랍인형 전시품도 교체가 되는 듯 하구요! 우리나라 셀럽들은 간혹 닮지 않은 사람들도 많은것 같지만,,,(아무래도 작업하는 사람이 외국인이라, 동양인에 대한 이해가 부족한듯?) 특징들을 하나 둘 살펴보며 인물 맞추기 하는 재미가 있습니다. 공간 구석구석 잘 꾸며두었어요",이미사용중,5,775,"It's worth a visit to an exotic and fun experience! There were many points to take pictures of, so I enjoyed watching them. Not only are there the same exhibits every time, but the wax figures seem to be replaced! Korean celebrities sometimes seem to have a lot of people who don't look like them, but it's fun to look at the characteristics one by one and match characters. It's decorated every inch of the spaces."
많이 비슷하진 않지만 그래도 외국인 친구와 같이 오면 굉장히 좋아하더라구요 여기서 관광을 하고 옆에 있는 카페에서 식사를 하는 것을 추천합니다.,혜지 박,5,775,"It's not that similar, but he really likes it when he comes with a foreign friend. I recommend you to go sightseeing here and have a meal at the cafe next to you."
"한번은 꼭, 두번은 글쎄... 모두의 반응과 마찬가지로 한번은 꼭 가볼만 한데..두번째 가기는 힘들어보입니다. 접근성이나 시설의 완성도나 전시물의 흥미로움이 모두 다 좋은데요, 상설전시의 한계이기는 한데 시민들 모두가 한번씩, 그리고 관광객들도 한번씩 들린다면 그것도 좋은 시장이기는 한데요, 재방문을 위한 참신한 기획이 더 있으면 인근을 들릴 떄마다 가족단위의 문화생활이 더 풍성해질 듯..",Sei-Hyun B,3,775,"Once, twice, I don't know... Like everyone's reaction, it's worth a visit.It seems hard to go to the second place. The accessibility, the completeness of the facilities, and the interest of the exhibits are all good, which is the limit of the permanent exhibition, but if all the citizens and tourists can hear it once, it is a good market, but if there are more fresh plans for revisiting, the cultural life of the family unit will be more abundant whenever I visit the neighborhood."
우리나라에서 가장 잘 꾸며진 그레뱅뮤지엄 한번은 가봐야 하는 뮤지엄. 가족과 함께 가면 많은 영감을 줄수 있는 곳으로 유명 인사들의 여러 생활상과 인물상을 잘 묘사해 놓은 곳입니다. 어린이와 학생들한테 많은 도움이 되실것입니다.,Queen3839,4,775,"The best-decorated Grevin Museum in Korea is a museum to visit. It is a place where you can give a lot of inspiration if you go with your family, and it is a place where you can describe various life and character images of famous people. It will be very helpful for children and students."
좋아요 가족단위 구경하기 너무 좋네요 체험과 볼거리 모두 좋구요 전시물 잘 만들어져 있어요 한류스타 월드스타까지 멋져요,선희 강,5,775,"Good. It's great to see the family. It's good for both experience and attraction. The exhibits are well-made. Hallyu stars, world stars, even cool."
가족과 함께 즐거운 시간 큰기대 안하고 왔는데 너무 잘 만들어진 모형과 다양한 볼거리 체험들로 즐거운 시간 보냈어요,성재 이,5,775,I had a great time with my family. I didn't expect much. I had a great time with models and various things to see.
지루하지 않은 관람 정교한 인형을 보고 재미도 있고 의미도 있네요. 아이들이 지루해하지 않고 좋아하네요. 강추,Hwesoo H,4,775,It's fun and meaningful to see an elaborate doll that's not boring. The children like it without getting bored. a strong recommendation
"엄청좋았어요 애가 가자고해서갔는데이것저것볼게많아요~""^^ 아이들있는분들우한번씩가면좋을것같아용~~^^교통편이불편한것삐ㅣ고는아주좋아요",임 인,5,775,"0It was great. He asked me to go, and I got a lot of things to see. I think it would be good for people with children to go once in a while.It's very good to be comfortable with transportation."
리얼체험 방학이 끝나기전 그레뱅에서~~유명이들과 즐거운 놀이를 아이들과 함께 해요~ 놀랍게 비슷해요~~리얼예요^^ 놀러오세요,성현 T,5,775,"Before the end of the real-life vacation, let's have fun with famous people in Grevin. It's surprisingly similar.It's real. Come and see me."
"# _ 그레벵 - 뮤지엄 - 재밌었습니다 .. ! : ) 여러 유명인들을 이렇게도 볼수있었다니 , 밀랍인형이 진짜 같아서 감탄했습니다 .",Navigator728577,5,775,# _ Grevin. - Museum. - It was fun. I was amazed to see many famous people like this because the wax doll looked real.

재미있어요~ 생각보다 재미 있네요~ 아쉬운점은 체험이 어려워서 헤매면서 했어요 그래도 야구공도 던져보고 제일 신나했네요,현정 신,4,775,It's fun. It's funnier than I thought. The unfortunate thing was that I wandered around because it was difficult to experience. But I was so excited to throw a baseball.

I didn't get bored because there were games from time to time to time. It will arrive as soon as you get off at Euljiro Station, so it would be nice to come here!"

The wax exhibition was the best and the museum shop was the best!!There are many famous celebrity exhibition products prepared.Yoo Jae-seok, Lee Min-ho, Jang Geun-seok, Big Bang, Kim Yeon-ah, and so on."
"방문후기입니다. 개인적으로 이쪽 분야에 관심이 매우 많은 편이여서 프레xxx, 코엑스 등등 많이 감상을 하였습니다. 프랑스 회사에서 개최하고 있는 전시회라 더욱 더 큰 기대를 가지고 방문을 하였습니다. 결과적으로는 기대 이상이였습니다. 매 작품마다 생동감도 넘치고 높은 정교함을 가지고 있었습니다. 특히 개인적으로 톰 크루즈를 좋아하여 작품이 가장 기억에 남았습니다. 티켓이 적은 금액이 아니라 저같이 학생에게 있어서는 다소 부담스러운 부분이 있지만 친절한 직원 분들과 작품성이 만족스러워 아깝지 않은",태현 김,5,775,"This is a review of your visit. Personally, I have a lot of interest in this field, so I watched a lot of Prexxx, COEX, etc. It was an exhibition held by a French company, so I visited with even greater expectations. As a result, it was more than expected. Each piece was lively and had a high degree of sophistication. Especially, I personally like Tom Cruise, so the work was the most memorable. It's not a small amount of tickets, but it's a bit of a burden to students like me, but I'm not afraid to waste it because I'm satisfied with the kind staff and the quality of the work."

Grevin museum에서 친구들과 즐거운 시간이었습니다~ 사람이 많을까봐 저는 평일에 놀러갔는데 생각보다 공간이 넓어서 북적임이 없었습니다~ 단체관광객이 많은곳은 사진찍을때 불편할 것 같았는데 생각의외로 이곳은 그렇지 않았습니다 . 밀랍인형 뮤지엄중 제가 갔던 곳중에 제일 쾌적하고 잘되어있고 한국연예인이 많았습니다,사슴 D,5,775,"I had a great time with my friends at the Grevin Museum.I went to play on weekdays in case there were too many people, but the space was bigger than I thought, so there was no crowded area.~ I thought it would be uncomfortable to take pictures in places where there are many group tourists, but surprisingly, this place was not. Among the wax figure museums, it was the most pleasant, well-made, and there were many Korean entertainers."
명동의 핫플레이스 그레뱅뮤지엄 다양한 스타와 함께 해서 좋았습니다. 특히 한류스타 장근석씨도 보고요. ㅎㅎ 더운 여름에 오기 딱 좋은 곳,신혜 이,5,775,"It was good to be with various stars in the Grevin Museum, a hot place in Myeong-dong. Especially, I see Korean Wave star Jang Geun-seok. The perfect place to come in hot summer."
그레뱅 입구의 그레뱅 부띠끄 입구에선 밀랍인형을 축소한듯한 기념품도 판매하네요. 밀랍인형의 흥미를 개인적으로 소장하기에도 좋은것 같습니다. 김연아 피규어가 200불 정도 하니까 가격은 다소 부담스러운...,중달,5,775,"At the entrance to Grevin Butique, there are souvenirs that look like a miniature wax figure. It's also good for personal interest in wax figures. Kim Yu-na's figure is about $200, so the price is a bit too much..."
명동에가면 그레뱅 ! 명동에서 길건너면 있어서 길찾기가 쉬웠습니닼ㅋ 오랜만에 친구랑 새로운 추억을 만들었네요 밀랍인형도 퀄리티 높고 깨끗했습니다 외국인이 더 많은 곳 이었어요 한류열풍도 느꼈네요,유준 노,5,775,"If you go to Myeong-dong, Grevin! It was easy to find a way across the street from Myeong-dong. I made a new memory with my friend after a long time no see. The wax figures were also high-quality and clean. It was a place with more foreigners. I also felt the Korean Wave."

재미있네요 기대보다 더 재미있고 그냥전시가 아니라 체험해보고 대략 한시간 반정도가 소요되네요 1층에 커피매장도 있고 명동가서 맛있는거 먹으러가야겠네요,윤호 김,5,775,It's fun. It's more fun than I expected. It's not just an exhibition. It takes about an hour and a half. There's a coffee shop on the first floor and I'll go to Myeongdong to eat something delicious.
"'한번쯤' 방문하면 좋습니다. 워낙에 알려질대로 알려진 관광지이기 때문에, 아주 특별하고 신기한 것을 기대하고 가면 약간은 지루할지도. 하지만 섬세하게 만들어진 밀납인형은 신기하며 무서워, 한번쯤 찾아가볼만 합니다.",Seibin Park,4,775,"It's good to visit 'once in a while'. Since it is a well-known tourist destination, it may be a little boring if you expect something very special and interesting. However, the delicately made wax doll is amazing and scary, so it's worth visiting at least once."
재미있었어요 국내에 최초로 생긴 밀랍인형 뮤지엄이라고 해서 기대를 많이 했었는데 기대 이상으로 좋은 시간이었어요. 사진을 많이 찍을 수 있어요,은곰이,5,775,It was fun. It was the first wax museum in Korea. I was looking forward to it. It was a great time. I can take a lot of pictures.
친구와 와서 함께 사진 찍고 밀랍에 있는 인물들 친구와 와서 함께 사진 찍고 밀랍에 있는 인물들에 대해 새롭게 알게되고. 저와 친구들이 좋아하는 밀랍들을 발견하고 같이 사진찍는 즐거움이 있었습니다. 여자밀랍이 저에게 다가와서 금방이라도 고백을 할거 같은 느낌이 들어서 새로웠어요 얼마나~ 디테일 한지!,대환 윤,5,775,"I came here with my friend to take pictures of the people in the wax. I came here with my friend to take pictures of the people in the wax and get to know them anew. I had fun finding wax that my friends and I like and taking pictures together. I felt like a female wax would come up to me and confess soon, so it was very new. Detail Hanji!"
"셀럽들과 즐거운 시간!!!!!!!!!! 우리나라뿐만이 아닌 해외 셀럽들, 위인들 까지 다양한 밀랍인형들이 전시되어있어서 사진도 찍고 만져도 보고 정말 시간가는 줄 모를정도로 즐거운 박물관이었어요!!! 전시뿐만이 아니라 게임들도 여러가지 참여할 수 있고 게임하면서 찍힌 사진도 메일로 전송해주니까 더 좋았어요! 가족끼리 와도 뜻깊은 시간 보낼 수 있을 것 같아요ㅎㅎ 직접 만지고 체험할 수 있으니 더 신기하기도 하고 박물관은 지루하단 생각에서 벗어나기 좋은 곳 같아요!!!!!!ㄹ",8ㅅ8,5,775,"A fun time with celebrities!!!!!!!!! There were various wax figures not only in Korea but also overseas celebrities and great people, so it was a museum that was so fun that I couldn't even take pictures and see them even when I touched them!!! Not only the exhibition but also the games, and it was even better because they sent me pictures taken while playing the game by e-mail! I think I can have a meaningful time with my family.It's even more amazing to be able to touch and experience it myself, and I think the museum is a good place to get out of the boredom!!!!!!!!!L."
조금 더 특별한 시간을 원한다면 현명한 선택이 될 듯. 따분한 레파토리에 실증난 분들에게 특히 추천합니다. 밀랍인형 뿐만 아니라 여러 가지 체험시설이 있어서 더 재밌었네요. 비행기 착륙 게임이 있는데 실제로 파일럿이 된 것 같았어요. 1층에 있는 카페 음식도 맛있었습니다. 청계천이나 명동이 가까우니 근처랑 묶어서 데이트 한다면 더 좋을 듯요! 아쉬운 점은 주차장이 따로 없으니 인근 주차장을 이용해야 한다는 점입니다. 하지만 시청역이나 을지로 입구역 바로 앞이라 지하철 이용 추천합니다.,husky4th,5,775,"If you want a little more special time, it would be a wise time. I especially recommend it to those who are tired of the boring repertoire. It was more fun because there were many experience facilities as well as wax dolls. There's an airplane landing game, and it looks like it's actually a pilot. The food at the cafe on the first floor was also delicious. Cheonggyecheon Stream or Myeong-dong is nearby, so it would be better if you had a date with a nearby place! Unfortunately, there is no parking lot, so you have to use a nearby parking lot. But I recommend you to use the subway because it is right in front of the City Hall station or Euljiro entrance."
그래벵 뮤지엄 관람후기~!^^ 아이들이 유명인사들과 함께 직접 현장에서 만난 느낌 그대로 생생하게 체험하고 직접 사진도 찍으면서 아이들이 미래를 향한 꿈을 꿀수 있도록 만든 박물관인것 같아서 정말 행복한 시간인것 같아요~ 또 보고싶어하는 아이들을 보면서 정말 추천하고 싶어요^^,은경 임,5,775,A review of the Graveng Museum!I think it's a happy time because it's a museum where children can experience the feeling of meeting celebrities in person and take pictures and dream about their future. I really want to recommend it while looking at the children who want to see it.^^
"너무 좋네요! 입장료가 살짝 비싸긴 한데, 그에 비해 볼거리가 너무나 풍성합니다!! 강추!! 테마가 여러가지여서 그런지 관람시간이 오래걸렸답니다!",Dahyoni,5,775,"That's great! The entrance fee is a little bit expensive, but there are so many things to see!! It took a long time to watch because there were many themes!"
너무너무 재밌어요~~~~!!!! 배우들 밀랍인형이 배우들 사진이랑 진짜진짜 똑같았어요 진짜로 연예인이랑 사진찍는 것 같아서 기분이 너무너무 좋았어요 티켓으로 여러가지 체험도많이해서 좋은 추억을 만들고 갑니다~^^,538gracek,4,775,It's so much fun! The actors' wax figures were really the same as the actors' pictures. It felt like I was taking a picture with a celebrity. I had a lot of experiences with tickets so I made good memories.^^
