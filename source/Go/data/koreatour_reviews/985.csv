Hanok in the mountains is enough to make me feel that I am in Korea. If you request, you can also watch Gugak performance. When we visited, we saw a quartet of Korean traditional music, and the people wearing hanbok and handling traditional instruments were so beautiful. Food is usually at the level of Korean food. You may feel expensive just by looking at food and price, but you should think of this place as a place + food = price. There is a Korean restaurant, and there is a cafe where you can enjoy simple dishes."

Jung-eun K,"한식당은 가격 대비 실망 스러웠어요. 기와집 느낌도 덜 나고, 특히 창이 없는 방에서 식사 해서 경치를 즐길 수도 없었습니다. 미래 예약 해서 좋은 방을 잡으면 괜찮을 수도 있어요.",2,985,"The Korean restaurant was disappointing for the price. It was less like a tile-roofed house, and especially I couldn't enjoy the scenery because I ate in a windowless room. It might be okay if you reserve a good room for the future."

yumirin0000,"성북동의 서쪽, 창덕궁의 북쪽, 삼청터널의 끝이라 셔틀버스가 없으면 택시이용을 추천합니다. (한성대 입구역에서 걸을 수 있지만 꽤 거리가 있습니다.) 부지 내에 테라스가 있는 레스토랑과 조용한 녹음에 둘러싸인 한옥이 여기저기 산재해 있습니다. 레스토랑은 예전에는 고급 한정식밖에 없었지만 지금은 경영이 바뀌었는지 캐주얼한 메뉴도 있었습니다. 가격은 비싼 편이지만 만족할 만한 맛이었습니다. (서비스료가 10% 듭니다.)",5,985,"To the west of Seongbuk-dong, to the north of Changdeokgung Palace, and to the end of Samcheong Tunnel, if there is no shuttle bus, I recommend you to use a taxi. (You can walk at the entrance of Hansung University, but it's quite far.) There are terraced restaurants and hanoks surrounded by quiet recordings on the site. Restaurants used to only have high-end Korean food, but now they have a casual menu to see if management has changed. The price was expensive, but it was a satisfying taste. (The service charge will be 10% higher.)"

It seems like people in Seoul also stop by to hike around here or have lunch. My mother and I enjoyed the 'Jami' menu where we can see traditional music as lunch course was served. I recommend it to those who are going to Seoul because it was so good. It is a pleasant place with a different traditional atmosphere than Myeong-dong's miscellaneous atmosphere. I think it's okay to just come and enjoy lunch or dinner. It's a nice place.
ふくうめちゃん,무료 셔틀 버스를 타고 갔습니다. 삼청각 버스정류장에서 언덕을 내려가 볼 수 있어서 편했습니다. 녹음으로 둘러싸여 조용한 곳입니다. 해방감 있는 테라스에서 차를 마시면서 한가로이 지내다 왔습니다. 돌아오는 길은 내리막길이라 성북동까지 걸었습니다.,5,985,"I went there by free shuttle bus.

The bus stop was written in Japanese for easy understanding. I had a 45000 won lunch at Igung. There was a seat, but reservation is mandatory, so I made a reservation at JCB Plaza the day before. The dish was palatable and delicious. Makgeolli was served as a course and it was delicious! I'm full."
