익선동에서 유독 특색확실한 곳이였어용 막 그냥 여성의류파는곳들 사이에서 정체성뚜렷해보였어요! 매장이 입구에서 쳐다본것보다 들어가니까 꽤 넓더라구용 찬찬히 구경하다보니 허리치마라고 부르는 옷이 정말 좋았어요 랩스커트같은거라 데이트할때 입으려구 겟해버렸어요ㅋㅋㅋ 화사하구 샤랑랑 거리는 원피스도 있었어요 저는 다른친구들도 끌고가려구용😚😚,yoonjian,5,1314,"It was a unique place in Ikseon-dong. It just seemed like a very clear identity among women's clothing stores! The store was quite spacious when I went in rather than looking at the entrance. I really liked the clothes called a waistcoat. It's like a lap skirt, so I got it for a date.There was a bright dress and a dress that was walking with her. I'm going to take my other friends."
예쁜 생활한복집 인테리어도 한복도 다 너무 예뻐서 한참 구경했습니다. 생활한복이라 그런지 한복치고는 가격도 괜찮고 엄마랑 여행가서 입으려고 한 벌씩 장만했는데 평소에 입어도 괜찮네요. 한복집가서 입어보는건 불가능하지만 여긴 편하게 입어보고 고를 수 있어서 좋았던것 같아요. 직원들도 친절하게 도와줘서 좋았습니다. 익선동 골목 지나다보면 눈에 띄어서 찾기 어렵지 않을것 같습니다.,Lee,5,1314,"I looked around for a long time because the interior of the pretty living hanbok house and Hanbok were all so pretty. Maybe it's because it's a daily Hanbok, but it's affordable for hanbok, and I bought a pair to wear on a trip with my mom, but it's okay to wear them on a regular basis. It's impossible to try it on at the Hanbok restaurant, but I think it was nice to try it on and choose it comfortably. It was good that the staff helped me kindly. If you go through Ikseon-dong Alley, it will be hard to find it because it stands out."
